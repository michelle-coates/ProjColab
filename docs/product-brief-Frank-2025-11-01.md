# Product Brief: Frank

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Author:** Michelle
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

Frank is an AI collaboration tool that transforms product decision-making by challenging assumptions and surfacing evidence rather than relying on subjective scoring methods. Unlike traditional prioritization frameworks (RICE, Impact/Effort) that depend on gut-feel estimates, Frank interrogates product decisions through intelligent questioning to help resource-constrained teams maximize development ROI.

**The Problem:** Early-stage companies struggle with a critical visibility gap where 50+ micro-improvements fall through organizational cracks while teams focus on strategic roadmap items. These small improvements—data quality fixes, UI enhancements, workflow optimizations—often directly support strategic goals like churn reduction but lack systematic prioritization and impact tracking.

**The Solution:** Frank operates at dual altitudes with Mini Frank (MVP focus) managing micro-improvements through AI-powered interrogation, pairwise ranking, and strategic clustering, while future Frank Core will handle strategic prioritization. The platform emphasizes human-AI collaboration over automation, asking "What evidence supports this assumption?" rather than "Rate this 1-5."

**Target Market:** Resource-constrained product leaders including startup founders (Pre-Series A to Series B) and senior PMs leading small teams (2-5 people) who need to maximize limited development resources and ensure every decision drives measurable business value.

**Business Model:** Freemium SaaS with Frank Lite (free), Frank Pro ($19/month individual), Frank Team ($49/user/month), and Frank Enterprise (custom pricing). Positioned between productivity tools and enterprise PM platforms, targeting teams currently using Notion/Miro rather than heavy PM tools.

**Competitive Advantage:** First-mover in micro-improvement prioritization with evidence-based AI interrogation approach, community-driven growth strategy through PM ecosystems, and cost-optimized technical architecture enabling sustainable freemium model.

## Problem Statement

Product teams struggle with a critical visibility and prioritization gap that undermines strategic objectives. While large strategic initiatives receive proper roadmap attention, smaller but impactful improvements—often 50+ items per organization—fall through organizational cracks.

**The Core Problem:**
- **Shadow Backlogs**: Teams create chores and tickets without product visibility, leading to fragmented prioritization
- **Lost Strategic Value**: Small improvements that directly support strategic goals (like "Reduce Churn" or "Improve Data Quality") get deprioritized despite potentially significant cumulative impact
- **Inconsistent Decision-Making**: Prioritization happens ad-hoc based on who complains loudest or which team member has the most influence, rather than evidence-based value assessment
- **No Impact Tracking**: Unlike major initiatives, small improvements lack measurement frameworks, making it impossible to learn what types of micro-changes deliver the most value

**Real-World Impact:**
- Data quality issues persist (like unit conversion errors) that could be fixed with simple validation rules
- Client confidence erodes due to preventable errors that "aren't important enough" for the roadmap
- Teams waste time in meetings debating which small improvements to tackle without clear evaluation criteria
- Valuable insights from domain experts (like DAs) get lost in organizational silos

**The Opportunity Cost:**
When 50+ small improvements remain unaddressed, teams miss cumulative value that could significantly impact strategic metrics like customer retention, operational efficiency, and data quality—all while maintaining focus on major roadmap initiatives.

## Proposed Solution

Frank is an AI collaboration tool that transforms product decision-making through evidence-based interrogation rather than subjective scoring. Unlike traditional prioritization frameworks (RICE, Impact/Effort) that rely on gut-feel estimates, Frank challenges assumptions and surfaces evidence to keep product decisions honest.

**Core Innovation: Dual-Altitude Product Intelligence**

Frank operates at two complementary levels:

**Frank Core (Strategic Level):**
- **Evidence Interrogation**: Instead of asking "Rate the impact 1-5," Frank asks "What evidence supports this assumption? How will you measure success? What does good look like?"
- **Pairwise Reasoning**: Teams compare initiatives through guided questioning that builds consensus and transparent rationale
- **Assumption Challenges**: When someone claims "this dashboard will improve engagement," Frank prompts for current active user data, specific engagement mechanisms, and measurable outcomes
- **Deep Dive Brainstorming**: When initial questioning reveals knowledge gaps, Frank can launch BMAD-powered brainstorming sessions to explore complex features or assumptions more thoroughly, helping teams get to the truth behind their product hypotheses

**Mini Frank (Micro-Improvement Level):**
- **Shadow Backlog Visibility**: Captures the 50+ small improvements hiding in Jira chores and team conversations
- **Contextual Interrogation**: Asks targeted questions appropriate to scale: "Who benefits most? How often is this mentioned in support tickets? Is this visible to users?"
- **Thematic Intelligence**: Clusters related micro-improvements to reveal strategic themes and suggest focused improvement sprints
- **Exploration Gateway**: For complex chores or user stories that need deeper analysis, Frank can initiate targeted brainstorming sessions to uncover root causes, alternative solutions, or hidden strategic value

**Unique Value Propositions:**

1. **Interrogation Over Calculation**: Frank doesn't score decisions—it helps teams articulate and validate the reasoning behind scores
2. **Collaborative Evidence Building**: Creates shared language for product reasoning across the entire organization
3. **Continuous Learning Loop**: Tracks outcomes of both strategic bets and micro-improvements to improve future questioning and prioritization
4. **Cultural Amplification**: Makes product thinking everyone's job while maintaining transparency and accountability

**The Feedback Intelligence Layer:**
Frank closes the loop by tracking implementation outcomes and using that evidence to refine its interrogation patterns, creating an organization that gets better at product reasoning over time.
